# Welcome

#### I'm a recent graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Madison currently seeking entry level employment in the field of software development. I'm currently working on organizing and uploading some personal projects here on github.  No projects found here are the *fill in the blank* type programming assignments from school.

## Projects I'm Currently Working On

* A machine learning model to predict sport outcomes for websites such as draftkings or fanduel.  Written in python. *(Currently Private)*
* An American Football simulation engine written in C#. *(Currently private)*
